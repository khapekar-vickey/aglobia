== Description ==

Provides geographic information detected by an IP adress. This can be used in themes or other plugins, as a shortcode, or via CSS body classes. The city & country names are translated in different languages ([supported languages](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services/#Languages-8)).

= Features: =

* Provides these 5 functions (see [API Documentation](https://github.com/yellowtree/geoip-detect/wiki/API:-PHP)):
  * `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_ip($ip, $locales = array('en'), $options = array())`: Lookup Geo-Information of the specified IP
  * `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip($locales = array('en'), $options = array())`: Lookup Geo-Information of the current website user
  * `geoip_detect2_get_current_source_description(...)`: Return a human-readable label of the currently chosen source.
  * `geoip_detect2_get_external_ip_adress()`: Fetch the internet adress of the webserver
  * `geoip_detect2_get_client_ip()`: Get client IP (even if it is behind a reverse proxy)
* You can use one of these data sources (see [comparison](https://github.com/yellowtree/geoip-detect/wiki/FAQ#which-data-source-should-i-choose)):
  * Free (default source): [HostIP.info](http://www.hostip.info/) (IPv4 only)
  * Free with registration: [Maxmind GeoIP2 Lite City](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), automatically updated weekly
  * Commercial: [Maxmind GeoIP2 City](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-country-database) or [Maxmind GeoIP2 Country](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city)
  * Commercial Web-API: [Maxmind GeoIP2 Precision](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services) (City, Country or Insights)
  * Hosting-Provider dependent: [Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168236-What-does-CloudFlare-IP-Geolocation-do-) or [Amazon AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/enhanced-cloudfront-customization/) (Country)
  * Free or Commercial Web-API: [Ipstack](https://ipstack.com)
* For the property names, see the results of a specific IP in the wordpress backend (under *Tools > Geolocation IP Detection*).
* You can include these properties into your posts and pages by using the shortcode `[geoip_detect2 property="country.name" default="(country could not be detected)" lang="en"]` (where 'country.name' can be one of the other property names as well, and 'default' and 'lang' are optional).
* You can show or hide content by using a shortcode `[geoip_detect2_show_if country="FR, DE" not_city="Berlin"]TEXT[/geoip_detect2_show_if]`. See [Shortcode Documentation](https://github.com/yellowtree/geoip-detect/wiki/API:-Shortcodes#show-or-hide-content-depending-on-the-location).
* When enabled on the options page, it adds CSS classes to the body tag such as `geoip-province-HE`, `geoip-country-DE` and `geoip-continent-EU`.
* When enabled on the options page, the client IP respects a reverse proxy of the server.
* If you are using [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), you can use these shortcodes:
  * A select input with all countries, the detected country being selected by default: `[geoip_detect2_countries mycountry]`
  * A text input that is pre-filled with the detected city (or other property): `[geoip_detect2_text_input city property:city lang:fr id:id class:class default:Paris]`
  * Geolocation information for the email text: `[geoip_detect2_user_info]`

See [Documentation](https://github.com/yellowtree/geoip-detect/wiki) for more info.

= How can I use these functions? =

* You could choose the currency of the store based on the country name
* You could suggest an timezone to use when displaying dates
* You could show the store nearest to your customer
* You show or hide content specific to a geographic target group
* Etc. ... You tell me! I'm rather curious what you'll do with this plugin!
* Be careful to comply to the applicable laws. For example Regulation (EU) 2018/302 (going into effect 03 Dec 2018)...

**System Requirements**: You will need at least PHP 5.4.

=== Troubleshooting ===

Does `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip()` return the same country, regardless of where you are visiting the site from? Maybe your server has a reverse proxy configured. You can check this: Go to the options page and look for "reverse proxy". Are there 2 IPs listed there? If so, which one corresponds to your [public IP](https://www.whatismyip.com/)?
